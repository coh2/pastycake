Installing pastycake
====================

    python setup.py build sdist
    pip install dist/pastycake-<version>.tar.gz

You can also use ``easy_install`` instead of ``pip``, but you should prefer
``pip`` as it offers some features that ``easy_install`` is lacking, such as
the ability to uninstall.

Important
---------

``python setup.py install`` will *not* work due to idiosyncracies with python's
packaging system(s).
